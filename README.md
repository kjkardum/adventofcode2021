# Advent Of Code 2021
It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas 
🎄 ⭐️ 🌨 ❄️ ☃️ 🏂

## Challenge

This year to challenge myself I chose to do every day in a different language.

## After 25 days...

It was a really interesting experience. This gave me a chance to try some of the languages I would never have used otherwise while having fun solving programming puzzles. Still, I would not repeat the same challenge next year. Maybe I find another unique one. If you would like to check out another AoC challenge, then check out [my AoC 2020 repository](http://github.com/kjkardum/adventofcode2020) where I solved (almost) every day in one line of python code.
